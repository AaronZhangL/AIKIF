"rating","goal_type","description"
"0.8","goal-oriented behavior","behavior that steers the world, or a piece of it, towards a single state, or a describable set of states"
"0.8","goal-oriented cognition","A mind which possesses a mental image of the 'desired' state of the world, and a mental image of the actual state of the world, and which chooses actions such that the projected future of world-plus-action leads to the desired outcome state"
"0.8","goal","The image or statement that describes what you want to achieve"
"0.8","causal goal system","A goal system in which desirability backpropagates along predictive links. If A is desirable, and B is predicted to lead to A, then B will inherit desirability from A, contingent on the continued desirability of A and the continued expectation that B will lead to A. Since predictions are usually transitive if C leads to B, and B leads to A, it usually implies that C leads to A the flow of desirability is also usually transitive"
"0.8","child","A prerequisite of a parent goal; a state or characteristic which can usefully be considered as an independent event or object along the path to the parent goal"
"0.8","parent","A source of desirability for a child goal. The end to which the child goal is the means. 'Parent goal' describes a relation between two goals - it does not make sense to speak of a goal as being 'a parent' or 'a child' in an absolute sense, since B may be a parent goal of C but a child goal of A"
"0.8","subgoal","An intermediate point on the road to the supergoals. A state whose desirability is contingent on its predicted outcome"
"0.8","supergoal","The root of a directional goal network. A goal which is treated as having intrinsic value, rather than having derivative value as a facilitator of some parent goal. An event-state whose desirability is not contingent on its predicted outcome. (Conflating supergoals with subgoals seems to account for a lot of mistakes in speculations about Friendly AI.)"
"0.5","Problem","Problem to be solved while building the AI (not part of normal goals) - documentation of issues"
