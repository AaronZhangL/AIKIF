====================
 AIKIF Requirements
====================
This document describes the goals and requirements of AIKIF.

The intention is to allow all of your information to be accessible, searchable and managed by yourself.

Rather than manually run scripts to perform tasks, these are catalogued and structured so they can be automated.
 

Goals
=====
- Framework to collect and map information to knowledge
- Process Automation
- Control of Personal data
- AI monitoring 

Goal 1 - Framework to collect and map information to knowledge
------------------------------
map data to knowledge using your own rules
``````````````
map data to knowledge using your own rules

store disparate data locally, backup globally

Goal 2 - Process Automation
------------------------------------
automatic documentation of program development

Log intent, progress and outcomes of all AI / Data processing tasks.

automatic collection, validation and processing of data


Goal 3 - Control of Personal data
------------------------------------
get your data off the cloud and under your control

agents to download data from various cloud hosts and store locally

index data locally for simple unified search across all sources (facebook, email, documents, photo metadata, web favourites)

Goal 4 - AI monitoring (future)
-----------------------------------
Define methods an AI can use (aikif.toolbox)

Log all results with useful milestones and checkpoints

Regulate processes to allow automation

black box monitoring of unknown software agents

Monitor for friendliness (unlikely to be achievable)
