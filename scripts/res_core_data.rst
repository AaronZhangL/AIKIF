Abstract
=====================================

This paper compares various methods of collecting and categorising raw data into standardised information.
The AIKIF framework is used to prototype and test results using a selection of actual data and randomly generated raw data.

Introduction
=====================================

Information from different sources is difficult to combine and use effectively on a personal basis.

This paper tests methods to integrate information and measure the effectiveness of access, indexing and retrieval.


Methods/Procedure
=====================================
The following results are auto-generated

Method 1 - Ontological Mapping
---------------------------------------

- Data File : test1.dat

running source data test1.dat .... 

- Data File : test2.dat

running source data test2.dat .... 

Method 2 - Method 2 - Drill Up / Drill down
---------------------------------------

- Data File : test1.dat

running source data test1.dat .... 

- Data File : test2.dat

running source data test2.dat .... 




Results
=====================================

TODO - results should be autogenerated


Conclusions
=====================================

The conclusion will need to be analysed and added here after the results are run
