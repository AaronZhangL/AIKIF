Each instance of #$TransportationDevice is an artifact designed to move an object from one location to another, by (for example) carrying, pulling, or pushing the transported object.  Instances of this collection may or may not have their own power source (see #$SelfPoweredDevice).  Those that do, such as automobiles and speedboats, constitute the specialization #$TransportationDevice-Vehicle.  Other transportation devices (for example, instances of #$Wheelbarrow or #$Bicycle) require an external motive force.  Because #$transporter and #$transportees are specializations of #$objectMoving, it follows that any object in the role of #$transporter moves as a whole with those objects playing the role of #$transportees.  Consequently, since any instance of #$TransportationDevice has playing the role of #$transporter as its intended function, stationary objects which cause motion, such as conveyor belts, escalators, rocket launchers, and slingshots, are excluded from the collection #$TransportationDevice.

That is, if the sequences <... ARGN ...> and <... ARGN-PRIME ...> differ at most in their Nth items and both (PRED ... ARGN ...) and (PRED ...

For example, #$singleEntryFormatInArgs holds of #$biologicalMother with respect to its second argument-place, since an animal can only have one biological mother.

"1858","NoteOnTheClassificationOfAktionsarten","rdf-schema#comment","This refers to the classification of verb phrases according to their denotation in accomplishments, achievements, activities and states, a classification that is standardly used in many NL semantics treatments -- i.e., according to the `type of action' they denote (not sure when the German term came into use, but it seems that it's now in common use). The standard contemporary reference for the classification is work by the philosopher Zeno Vendler, although its origins are traced to #$Aristotle's writings. (1) *Accomplishments* have an intrinsic completion or `culmination' point: an event of this type may occur without reaching this culmination. Example: you may write a letter for 2 hours, though it's not necessarily the case that the letter is written when you stop. (2) *Achievements* are logically `point-like': in an event of this type, whatever occurs previously is generally irrelevant to whether it's felicitous to assert that the event has taken place. Example: `reaching New York City' (after a long trip, say) is an achievement event: it occurs *when* you get there. Suppose you drive for 36 hours toward NYC, but stop in NJ just before crossing the Hudson: then you have *not* reached NYC, even though of course you *have driven to* NYC for quite a long time. This also shows the distinction between achievements (`reaching NYC') and accomplishments (`driving to NYC', which may or may not be completed by getting there). (3) *Activities*: these are occurrences that take place somewhat `uniformly' over time, without a definite completion point. Example: just *writing* is something you can do for a while -- whereas *writing a letter* is an accomplishment, in that it has a definite culmination. (4) *States*: these aren't events at all, in that they denote the holding true of a condition, not the occurrence of a change. In Cyc, this classification is partially reflected by specs of #$Situation and a cluster of collections of event types: #$AccomplishmentType corresponds to (1). #$ProcessType corresponds more or less to (3). States (4) aren't clearly represented in and of themselves: #$StaticSituation comes closest, although most of the verbs Vendler-Aristotle would classify as *stative* are actually represented as relations. (2) is partially captured by another distinction that cuts across the traditional classification of (1), (2) and (3): that between #$DurativeEventType and #$PunctualEventType (for which check out also the #$NoteOnDurativeVsPunctualEvents). The classification of Aktionsarten is essential to characterizing the temporal interpretation of aspect and tense."

"2176","intervalEntryFormatInArgs","rdf-schema#comment","An instance of #$SpecificEntryFormatPredicate (q.v.) that is used only with argument-places that are constrained to instances (see #$argIsa) of either #$ScalarInterval or #$TimeInterval or some specialization of either.  (#$intervalEntryFormatInArgs PRED N) means that, for any particular way of fixing the other arguments to PRED besides the Nth, for any two intervals such that if either one is taken as the Nth argument PRED holds of those arguments, those intervals must ""overlap"" (see #$quantityIntersects and #$temporallyIntersects).  That is, if the sequences <... ARGN ...> and <... ARGN-PRIME ...> differ at most in their Nth items and both (PRED ... ARGN ...) and (PRED ... ARGN-PRIME ...) hold, then (i) if (#$argIsa PRED N #$ScalarInterval) then (#$quantityIntersects ARGN ARGN-PRIME) holds and (ii) if (#$argIsa PRED N #$TimeInterval) then (#$temporallyIntersects ARGN ARGN-PRIME) holds.   

For example, #$intervalEntryFormatInArgs holds of #$bodyTemperature with respect to its second argument-place because, while a given creature (at a given moment in time) has a single exact (see #$ScalarPointValue) body temperature, we want the predicate #$bodyTemperature to be flexible enough to allow us to specify this temperature with varying degrees of precision (e.g. as ""98.6 degrees Fahrenheit"" or as ""between 98 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit"" or as ""less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit"").

For another example, #$intervalEntryFormatInArgs holds of #$foundingDate with respect to its second argument-place because, while a given city has a single exact (see #$startingPoint) time when it was founded, we want the predicate #$foundingDate to be flexible enough to allow us to specify this date with varying degrees of precision (e.g. as ""June 14, 1964,"" ""June 1964,"" or simply ""1964"").

Note that many interval-entry format argument-places that are constrained to time-intervals have #$Date as their asserted #$argIsa constraint."

"2262","List","rdf-schema#comment","A specialization of #$Tuple.  Each instance of #$List is a  finite sequence of things with a first and last member-position, with each member-position other than the last having a successor member-position.   As with tuples generally, lists allow for repetition of their members, so that the same item can appear at multiple member-positions in the same list.  A list can be represented formally as a function from a finite index set of counting numbers, beginning with one, into the domain of all #$Things (but note that #$Lists are _not_ explicitly represented as functions in the Cyc ontology).  Unlike an instance of #$Series (q.v.), a list is purely abstract (i.e. both aspatial and atemporal), and the only implied relation between an item and its successor in a list is the successor relation of the list itself.  Technically, #$List is more specific than #$Tuple only in that the index set (see #$tupleIndexSet) for a given list must be the counting numbers in their usual order (or some initial segment thereof), whereas the index set for a tuple, generally speaking, might be any set whatsoever."

"2625","SetOrCollection","rdf-schema#comment","A specialization of #$MathematicalThing.  Something is an instance of #$SetOrCollection just in case it is a collection (i.e. an instance of #$Collection) or a mathematical set (i.e. an instance of #$Set-Mathematical).  Instances of #$Set-Mathematical and instances of #$Collection (and thus instances of #$SetOrCollection) share some basic common features.  All instances of #$Collection and all instances of #$Set-Mathematical (and thus all instances of #$SetOrCollection) are abstract entities, lacking spatial and temporal properties.  Nearly all instances of #$Collection (except ""empty"" collections) and nearly all instances of #$Set-Mathematical (except the empty set; see #$TheEmptySet) have ""elements"" (i.e. instances or members; see #$elementOf); hence set-or-collections may stand to one another in generalized set-theoretic relations such as #$subsetOf and #$disjointWith (qq.v.).  (It is this shared feature of having elements that provides the basic rationale for reifying the collection #$SetOrCollection.)  Nevertheless, sets and collections differ in two important ways.  First, each collection is intrinsically associated with an intensional criterion for membership -- a more or less natural property (or group of properties) possessed by all of (and only) its elements.  Collections are thus akin to kinds.  In contrast, the elements of a set are not required to be homogeneous in any respect: any things whatsoever may together constitute the elements of a set.  The second major difference between sets and collections is that no two distinct sets can be coextensional (i.e. have exactly the same elements; see #$coExtensional).  Sets can thus be identified purely on the basis of their extensions (see #$extent).  Collections, on the other hand, are individuated by their intensional criteria for membership.  So collections that have exactly the same elements might nevertheless be distinct, differing in their respective membership criteria.  (Note that the general relationship between collections and their ""intensional criteria for membership"" in the above sense is not something that is currently represented explicitly in the Knowledge Base (though this seems a worthwhile area for future work); still the #$comment and other ""definitional"" assertions on a given collection should ideally convey a reasonably clear and precise idea of its associated membership criterion.)"

#$Bookcase-PieceOfFurniture), and (iv) providing illumination (e.g. 
#$ElectricLamp).  Most pieces of furniture are #$NonPoweredDevices

"3378","AbstractInformationStructure","rdf-schema#comment","A specialization of #$AbstractStructure.  Each instance of #$AbstractInformationStructure is an abstract individual comprising abstract symbols and relations between them. Important specializations of this collection include #$CharacterString and #$Sentence. #$AbstractInformationStructure also includes abstract diagrams, graphs, and bit strings. The collection can be more precisely defined as follows: Each #$AbstractInformationStructure is such that each of its physical instantiations (see #$instantiationOfAIS) consists of instantiations of instances of #$AtomicSymbol-Abstract, arranged in a certain way. For example, the abstract sentence 'The pig flies' is an #$AbstractInformationStructure. Each written instantiation of it consists of an instantiation of the words (symbols) 'The', 'pig' and 'flies', written in that order. (If the #$AbstractInformationStructure 'The pig flies' were spoken, the same words would appear in the same order, i.e. 'The' first, etc., but the sequence would be determined by the arrangement of the spoken words in time, rather than space.) Likewise with abstract diagrams, graphs, etc. Each of these is such that its physical instantiations consist of arrangements of instantiations of instances of #$AtomicSymbol-Abstract. A hard copy of a wiring diagram consists of a group of concrete symbols representing various circuit components, in which these symbols are spatially arranged in a certain in way. The arrangement of the concrete symbols in an instantiation of an #$AbstractInformationStructure is not always a simple matter of arrangement in space or time. The sequence of symbols '0010010111011001' can be instantiated in written, spoken, or electronic forms. In the last case, the order of the symbols is determined by conventions concerning the electronic medium in which it is stored, rather than by any common criterion for precedence or subsequence in space or time."

"4216","abductiveExpansion","rdf-schema#comment","An instance of #$UnderstandingEnrichmentRelation.  (#$abductiveExpansion EXPLANANDUM HYP-EXPLANANS) means that if EXPLANANDUM is true, a good way to make sense of EXPLANANDUM is to postulate that HYP-EXPLANANS is true, and that HYP-EXPLANANS broadens the level of detail in terms of which EXPLANANDUM is understood.  For example, if it is true that someone applies toothpaste to a toothbrush (and that is our explanandum), and it is known that applications of toothpaste to toothbrushes are typical components of events in which one brushes one's own teeth, then a good way to make sense of the application of toothpaste to the toothbrush is to suppose (as a hypthothetical explanans) that there is an event of which the application is a component which is itself an event in which the applier is brushing her own teeth. (#$abductiveExpansion EXPLANANDUM HYP-EXPLANANS) also means that the truth of EXPLANANDUM is evidence (though generally not sufficient evidence) for the truth of HYP-EXPLANANS.  Thus, if a person applies toothpaste to a toothbrush, that is evidence that she is about to brush her teeth. It is possible that various legitimate values for HYP-EXPLANANS are mutually inconsistent for a single value of EXPLANANDUM -- perhaps the reason someone applies toothpaste to a toothbrush is to brush a dog's teeth."

Members of different species of animals cannot produce fertile offspring by interbreeding.  If there are only two breeds of a given species and one breed becomes extinct, the second breed by virtue of that fact becomes an instance of #$BiologicalSpecies -- since the only organisms instances can breed with to produce fertile offspring are, at that point, members of that collection.  An instance of #$BiologicalSpecies has members who all have significant traits in common, and members of each biological species have other members as parents.  Exceptions occur when a species is conventionally defined to start since parenthood could conceivably be traced back billions of years, yet new species came into existence.  In biological taxonomy, related species are grouped into a particular instance of #$BiologicalGenus.  Some genera have only a single species, but they remain different taxons."

"5526","receivesServicesFrom","rdf-schema#comment","This predicate relates potential service recipients to service providers that are bound to provide services of some type to that agent.  The first argument place should be the potential recipient of service and the second argument place should contain the potential service provider.  The relationship holds while the agreement to provide the service is in place, not just while the service is being provided.  This agreement need not be a formal agreement but it should involve the service provider in a task for which he, she, it or the service provider's controller is paid, although not necessarily by the service recipient.  Hence, #$mother is not a specpred (#$specs) of this predicate but the relationship between a client and social worker or between parishioner and priest might be even if the client or parishioner does not pay for the service.  If a company, Company001, puts a lawyer, Lawyer001, on retainer, then it is true that (#$receivesServicesFrom Company001 Lawyer001) even before the lawyer has provided any services.  Usually it is preferable to use one of the specializations of this predicate. See, for instance, #$accountants, #$attorneys or #$hasWorkers. #$receivesServicesFrom is more general than #$hasWorkers as it can describe the relationship between a person and her dentist or priest and the relationship between an organization that may occassionally receive a service from an agent, e.g. a subcontractor.  If a business, Business001 has a certain accountancy firm, AccountantsRUs001, perform occasional bookkeeping work, it is not true throughout the year that (#$hasWorkers BusinessOO1 AccountsRUs001) but it may be true throughout the year that (#$receivesServicesFrom Business001 AccountantsRUs001)."

For example, #$PurposePredicate is an instance of #$PredicateTypeByTopic because instances of #$PurposePredicate are used to form sentences about purposes or goals.

"5607","ScalarInterval","rdf-schema#comment","i> (see #$Tuple) of intervals.  They are to be contrasted with #$VectorIntervals (q.v.), which possess a direction as well as a magnitude, and are construed as two-membered tuples of intervals.
<p>
#$ScalarInterval is partitioned into the two collections #$NumericInterval (which is the collection of numbers and number-ranges of all kinds) and #$Quantity (qq.v).  A #$Quantity is usually specified with a numeric-interval, as with (#$Meter 3)), but it might also be given in a generically-ranked way, as with (#$HighAmountFn #$Happiness); see the specializations #$MeasurableQuantity and #$NonNumericQuantity.  The magnitude of a scalar might be given by a specific number (see #$ScalarPointValue) or by a proper range of numbers (see #$ScalarProperInterval).
<p>
Note that the instances of #$MathematicalFunctionOnScalars (q.v.), which include artithmetic functions such as addition (see #$PlusFn) and division (see #$QuotientFn), are defined broadly so as to apply not only to numbers, but to (numerically-measured) scalar intervals generally.  Thus (#$PlusFn (#$Meter 3) (#$Meter 5)) is equal to (#$Meter 8)."

Each instance of the collection #$Obligation is specification of what some agent (related to the obligation via #$obligatedAgents (q.v.)) is obliged to do, or make true, for one or more other agents or possibly 'for' society in general.  An obligation is the most general case of some agent owing something to another.  Obligations may be undertaken in conjunction with various kinds of #$Agreements.   Unlike an agreement, however, an obligation need not have a second known party (though some do).  An obligation can exist and be understood without identifying another particular agent as the 'holder' of the obligation -- and that may be true, even if the beneficiary (#$obligationOwedTo) can be identified.  For example, assuming that parents have an obligation to care for their children, it is not clear with whom a parent has 'agreed' to take care of his or her child.  Some common ways to incur an obligation are through social transactions (e.g. family duties, friendship, favors) or through financial transactions (e.g. a #$PaymentObligation).   In addition, obligations may be imposed on those who are subject to one or more instances of #$CodeOfConduct, e.g. #$SportsRulesOf-BoxingSportsEvent or #$OfficeCodeOfConductMt."

Each instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW is a deliberately created abstract object composed of propositions that together constitute a list of instructions for computers to execute.  
<p>
Example instances include #$Emacs-TheProgram and #$LinuxKernel-TheProgram.
<p>
Instances of this collection are distinct from computer code and from both running and installed programs. The instructions that comprise an instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW can be expressed as abstract computer code (see #$ComputerCode), but no list of instructions expressed in code constitutes an instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW.  Rather, the code in which an instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW is expressed constitutes an instance of #$AbstractInformationStructure that can be related to the program it expresses using the predicate #$programCode.  More than one instance of #$ComputerCode can express the same instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW; for example,  a single instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW can be written in source code (see #$ComputerCode-Source) in several different computer languages, or it can be complied as a binary executable (see #$ComputerCode-Binary).  A physical instantiation of a #$ComputerProgram-CW is a #$ComputerProgramCopy which is an #$InformationBearingThing and is related to its #$ComputerProgram-CW by the predicate #$programCopies.  An instance of #$ComputerProgram-CW that is being executed is a #$ComputerProcessRunning, related to its #$ComputerProgram-CW by the predicate #$programOfProcess."
